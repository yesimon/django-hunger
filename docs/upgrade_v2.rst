Upgrading to Version 2
======================

Version 2 of Hunger is very different from v1. In v1 of the app, the
private beta phase was a pre-registration phase, meaning that it
operated by limiting access to registration until a user is invited to
the beta. In v2, the private beta becase a post-registration phase,
meaning that all users are allowed to register, but limiting access to
the rest of the site.

Due to the drastic differences between the two versions, there will be
no upgrade path between the two versions. However, for all future
upgrades, South migrations will be provided.
